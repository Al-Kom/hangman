[Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29) is a words
guessing game for one player. The computer guesses a word and the user
has to suggest letters one by one. Every time the word contains a letter,
the computer opens it (all of them, if there are a few). Every time the
word doesn't contain a letter, the computer gives a penalty point for
the user. If there are 10 penalty points, the user looses. If there
are no hidden letters any more the computer looses.
